# System Purpose
As part of the project task, it was necessary to implement a web application that serves as a centralized information system for a medical equipment procurement company, through which private hospitals can reserve and acquire equipment. The system is also accessible to administrators who can enter sales reports for the equipment. The system manages a large number of companies registered within the information system. The primary purpose of the application is to maintain records of employees, registered companies, equipment reservations and pickup schedules, users, and their profiles.
